# Simple Emotion Detection app with Embedded Watson AI
### Project Description
#### This simple AI-based web app deployed in python Flask framework performs analytics on customer feedback for their signature products. To accomplish this requirement, this Emotion Detection system processes feedback provided by the customer in text format and deciphers the associated emotion expressed.
.
#
### How it works
Basically the scipt takes text to be analyzed as an input text using the app UI. The scipt sends a POST request to the relevant model with the required text and the model will send the appropriate response.
Through NLP, this scipt categorizes customer feedbacks as happy, sad or angry etc accordingly.

### Tasks done:
```text
1: Created an Emotion Detection application using the functions from embeddable AI libraries
2: Extracted relevant information from the output received from the function
3: Tested and packaged the application created using the Emotion Detection function
4: Completed web deployment of the application using Flask
5: Incorporated error handling in the application to account for invalid input to the application
6: Written codes that are in perfect compliance with PEP8 guidelines, getting 10/10 score in static code analysis
```
