# Simple Emotion Detection app with Embedded Watson AI
### Project Description
#### This simple AI-based web app deployed in python Flask framework performs analytics on customer feedback for their signature products. To accomplish this requirement, this Emotion Detection system processes feedback provided by the customer in text format and deciphers the associated emotion expressed.
.
#
### How it works
Basically the scipt takes text to be analyzed as an input text using the app UI. The scipt sends a POST request to the relevant model with the required text and the model will send the appropriate response.
Through NLP, this scipt categorizes customer feedbacks as happy, sad or angry etc accordingly.
